# V1
* Should consider a servo for the angular motor to increase striking power.  Often skip steps when striking at high speed.
* Maybe something like this: https://www.robotshop.com/en/12v-313rpm-4166oz-in-hd-premium-planetary-gearmotor-encoder.html $59
* Control would be trickier and would still need calibration at the beginning, but could sense the actual movement of the motor.
* Some way of supporting absolute positioning would be beneficial
*  End stop would be cheapest, but would require recalibrating after striking the ball
*  Encoder would allow us to read the actual position at all times without recalibration
## Handle
* Handle Clamp doesn't fit quite right.
* Could use a way to get absolute position
## Idler Mount
* IdlerMount is difficult to print.  Maybe split into two pieces?
* Trouble getting square nut in slot
* Slide seems too wide
* Could use a rib to hold alignment with rail
* Could use a rib to keep nut from rotating
## Bracket
Works pretty well.  Sometimes a little difficult to get off.
* Consider adding a way to clamp to table bottom to prevent rotation
